This is an [ELAG 2016 Workshop Proposal](http://elag2016.org/programme/call-for-workshop-proposals/).

[ELAG 2016](http://elag2016.org/) will take place June 6-9 in Copenhagen.

## Workshop proposal

**Title:** Abandon your database, use Wikidata instead!

**Leader:** Jakob Vo√ü

**Audience:** Anyone interested in library data, Wikidata, or both 

**Short description:**
Wikidata is increasingly used as central database of statements, references,
and connections for Wikipedia and other projects. The database that anyone can
edit also contains authority files, bibliographic data and other content
normally managed in library databases. In the first part of the Workshop we
will find out how Wikidata works and what it contains by editing and querying
(bring your computer and questions).  In the second part we will collect ideas
and discuss what kind of data to put in or move into Wikidata, and what consequences
to expect or fear.

**Workshop outcome:**
Better understanding of possibilities, advantages, and disadvantages of putting library data into Wikidata
