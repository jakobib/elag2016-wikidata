# Brainstorming session (in groups)

EXIT our databases, enter Wikidata:\
_What types of data could be moved into Wkidata?_

* translations of labels and names
* additional quickly changing information\
  (e.g. author affiliation) 
* use of Wikidata as general authority file
    * to be used as hub with mappings 
* links between entities
* anything that could be asked for in SIRI

# More concrete examples

* data about events (such as ELAG)
* scientific articles and citations
* scientifical information with references (WikiCite)

# Open questions from the session

* Stable and consistently used set of Wikidata properties?
* What is the scope of Wikidata (data about anything?)
* What about notability criteria (data about everything?)
    * How to judge which areas are covered well or not?
    * Can't put every in Wikidata,\
      but the more is in, the more useful it is!
* Copyright on existing databases?
